## :scroll: Description
A puppy adoption sample app demonstrating building UI with compose. A submission for the #AndroidDevChallenge Jetpack Compose Week 1


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I have created a Compose App with a Video Player in details. Thanks to recomposition it is very easy to create multiples views and nesting layouts. You can see this in the lazyColumn and in the detail page.
